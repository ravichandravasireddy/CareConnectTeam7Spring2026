CareConnect Team7 Spring2026

## Description

**CareConnect** is a HIPAA-compliant mobile, desktop, and web application that connects patients (care recipients) and their caregivers for remote health management and coordination. The app supports shared flows, such as welcome, login, registration, and role selection, as well as role-specific experiences such as patient dashboard, profile, preferences, and health tools. Additionally, there are the caregiver dashboard, emergency SOS, patient monitoring, task management, and analytics screens. Shared features include messaging, calendar, task details, notifications, notes, health logs, health timeline, and video call, so both sides can coordinate care securely from one place.

The project specifically targets **hearing-impaired caregivers**. The Flutter UI is built with accessibility and clear visual feedback in mind, so caregivers who are deaf or hard of hearing can manage tasks, monitor patients, respond to alerts, and stay in touch without relying on audio. CareConnect aims to make remote care coordination inclusive and secure for everyone involved.
