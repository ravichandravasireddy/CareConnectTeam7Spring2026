# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Accessibility (Deaf & Hard of Hearing)

This app targets **hearing-impaired caregivers**. All feedback is **visual only**—no audio alerts or notifications. Key design rules:

- **No audio dependency**: Alerts, confirmations, and notifications use text, icons, and color
- **Visual alternatives**: Emergency SOS uses red background, large text, and clear icons
- **Text-based content**: Patient names, vitals, and task details are always displayed as text
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 48×48px for interactive elements
- **Color contrast**: WCAG AA compliant (see `_AI/GUIDELINES.md`)

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
